# Superstore_Return Rate Analysis with Data Visualization & Tableau Story

## Introduction <a id='intro'></a>

Here we did a further, more in-depth analysis for Superstore focusing solely on the return rate and the correlation it has with sales. We utilized Tableau Stories to present our findings and recommendations.

### Goal: 
Our two main goals were:
1. Analyze the return rate across several different metrics including sales, category, geographic region (state), and across a measure of time to view a potential seasonal effect. 
2. Create a dashboard and Story for presentation purposes to give Superstore recommendations on how to combat high return rates.

### Stages 

 
The project consisted of three main stages:
 1. Analyze the return rate across several different metrics including sales, category, geographic region (state), and across a measure of time to view a potential seasonal effect. Create visualizations for each step.
 2. Create a dashboard with the visualizations from previous stage.
 3. Create a Tableau Story with the most relevant individual visualizations and the dashboard, give an overiew of the dashboard, and present findings and recommendations via voice over.


After conducting our analysis, we concluded:

1. There is a correlation between return rate and sales, where as sales increase so does the return rate. Not a surprise when you consider that the more items sold will eventually lead to more total returns.
2. The office supplies category had the second highest return rate at 27%, but by far the most total returns at 7,472.
3. Time of year certainly has an effect on return rate, meaning there is a seasonal correlation that spikes around 'back-to-school' and the holiday season.
4. Recommended that Superstore conduct further qualitative analysis on why office supplies items are being returned at such a high rate and volume.
5. Also recommended the company takes extra care in preparring for seasonal return spikes by making the return process as smooth as possible for the customer. If they have a positive return experience, they are more likely to be a repeat customer in the future.
