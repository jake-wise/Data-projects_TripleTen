# Superstore_Data Visualization

## Introduction <a id='intro'></a>

For this project, we consulted for a company named Superstore by delivering data visualizations and actionable recommendations to enhance operational efficiency and profitability..

### Goal: 
Our three main goals were:
1. Analyze profit and losses with visualizations through multiple different combinations of given data. 
2. Create an advertising budget for for three states who had the top-3 highest performing months on average in terms of profit and provide visualizations. 
3. Analyze the return rates for customers and items and provide visualizations.

### Stages 

 
The project consisted of two main stages:
 1. Create visualizations for each task to be completed.
 2. Provide answers and recommendations based on the visualizations.


After conducting our analysis, we concluded:

1. Biggest profit centers were copiers being sold in the West Region and chairs being sold in the East Region. Biggest loss makers were binders in the Central region and tables in the East regions, with the worst performing product being an electric binding system.
2. The top-3 most profitable months on average and the corresponding states were Indiana in October, Vermont in November and Washingtion in March. The respective advertising bugdets for each state, based on 20% of average profit, were Indiana at $128.62, Vermont at $119.20 and Washington at $104.26.
3. The return rate analysis showed that as return rate went up, profit went down, which is not surprising as return items do not generate profit. The two most returned items came from the same category of office supplies.
