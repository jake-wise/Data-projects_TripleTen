# Data_projects_TripleTen

Projects I completed while attending the TripleTen Business Intelligence and Analytics program in 2024.


| Sprint | Project | Description   |
|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| 1 | [Spreadsheet Data Analysis](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1u7r_yy3UnyNvCRCxr1iUkdgdEQtV_68CvUt914RgGg0/edit?gid=2072559734#gid=2072559734) | Analyzed Airbnb data in New York City using pivot tables with the goal of finding the most desirable properties in terms of location, size and profit. Results yielded the top-3 neighborhoods as the Lower East Side, Hells Kitchen and Harlem and found the most profitable listings by monthly and annual expected revenue. |
| 2 | [Data Collection and Storage with SQL](https://tripleten.com/trainer/bi-analyst/lesson/32ddb20e-3ada-4aea-88d7-3ba42f2bd09c/task/b71ea9f7-de8c-4574-a13a-4a053562abec/) | Performed an exploratory analysis to gather relevant data, then investigated the effect that inclimate weather has on ride duration from the Loop to O'Hare International Airport in Chicago. Findings indicated that rainy days have longer ride times, suggested the company schedules more drivers on anticipated rainy days. |
| 3 | [Business Analytics](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RcYERi2I4XzXuIAlcRxKrT2ZAll2nhKdTPpWgnoNuAg/edit?gid=38637670#gid=38637670) | Utilized advanced Excel knowledge to create a cohort analysis and conversion funnel for an E-Commerce company looking to analyze how effective their website was converting pageviews into purchases. Analysis showed their conversion rates were extremely low at each step of the purchase process, and repeat purchases were less likely to occur over the life of the cohort. Suggested the company offer customers a discount if a minimum value was met in their shopping carts to increase the conversion rate as well as entice customers to revisit the website. |
| 4 | [Data Visualization with Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/jacob.wise3346/viz/JakeWise_Superstore_Project_Final/Avg_ProfitvReturnRatebyState) | Consulted for the Superstore compnay to assess operations and increase profitability. Used detailed visualizations with Tableau to show the biggest profit centers and loss makers, worst performing products, and the most profitable sub-categories based on the region of the United States. Created an advertising budget for the top-3 highest performing months in terms of profit and the corresponding state tied to that month. The budget was calculated using 20% of the profit accumulated for each state their respective highest performing month. |
| 5 | [Storytelling with Data](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/jacob.wise3346/viz/Sprint5Project__JakeWise/SuperstoreReturnRateFindings) | Conducted further analysis of Superstore focusing more on return rate. Used detailed visualizations and dashboards to convey the correlation between return rate and sales. Created a story using Tableau to present findings and offer solutions to high volume return items and the seasonal spikes in returns. |
| 6 | [Power BI] | Reviewed the landscape of apps on Shopify platform and was tasked with finding out what helps make an app successful on Shopify. Used raw data to create visualizations and the DAX language to create new columns in the data to ultimately find out that developers who responded and interacted with those who left reviews on their apps where more likly to be successful. |
