|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| 1 | [Spreadsheet Data Analysis](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1u7r_yy3UnyNvCRCxr1iUkdgdEQtV_68CvUt914RgGg0/edit?gid=2072559734#gid=2072559734) | Analyzed Airbnb data in New York City using pivot tables with the goal of finding the most desirable properties in terms of location, size and profit. Results yielded the top-3 neighborhoods as the Lower East Side, Hells Kitchen and Harlem and found the most profitable listings by monhtly and annual expected revenue. |
| 2 | [Data Collection and Storage with SQL](https://tripleten.com/trainer/bi-analyst/lesson/32ddb20e-3ada-4aea-88d7-3ba42f2bd09c/task/b71ea9f7-de8c-4574-a13a-4a053562abec/) | Performed an exploratory analysis to gather relevant data, then investigated the effect that inclimate weather has on ride duration from the Loop to O'Hare International Airport in Chicago. Findings indicated that rainy days have longer ride times, suggested the company schedules more drivers on anticipated rainy days. |
| 3 | [Business Analytics](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RcYERi2I4XzXuIAlcRxKrT2ZAll2nhKdTPpWgnoNuAg/edit?gid=38637670#gid=38637670) | Utilized advanced Excel knowledge to create a cohort analysis and conversion funnel for an E-Commerce company looking to analyze how effective their website was converting pageviews into purchases. Analysis showed their conversion rates were extremely low at each step of the purchase process, and repeat purchases were less likely to occur over the life of the cohort. Suggested the company offer customers a discount if a minimum value was met in their shopping carts to increase the conversion rate as well as entice customers to revisit the website. |
