# Business Analytics_Cohort Analysis and Conversion Funnel

## Introduction <a id='intro'></a>

For this project, we created a conversion funnel and cohort analysis for an e-commerce company looking to analyze how well their website was converting page views into purchases

### Goal: 
Our three main goals were:
1. Create a conversion funnel using pivot tables to see how effectively the website was converting page views to purchases at each step of the buying process. 
2. Prepare data and conduct cohort analysis based on the month of the user's first purchase. 
3. Calculate the retenion rates for each cohort over the life of the cohort, month by month for 4 months.

### Stages 

 
The project consisted of three stages:
 1. Data cleaning and calculations.
 2. Identifying and creating the cohorts.
 3. Finding the life of the cohort and calculating retention rates over that life.


After conducting our analysis, we found:

1. The conversion funnel showed that the website was only converting 10% of starting customers, or those who viewed the website (1st step of funnel) into pahing customers (those who made a purchase, 3rd and final step of funnel).
2. However, the conversion rate from step 2 (shopping cart) to step 3 (purchase) was 36%, which was higher than the conversion rate from step 1 (page view) to step 2 (shopping cart), which was 29%, indicating that once someone had items in their shopping cart, they were more likely to purchase it. We recommended offering discounts to customers if they reached a certain minimum total in their shopping cart, to incentivize purchases.
3. The retention rate steadily and significantly decreased over the life of each cohort, even though the starting size of each cohort grew every month. This indicates that pageviews were increasing but repeat customers were not. We recommened starting a membership program with benefits to increase repeat customers.
