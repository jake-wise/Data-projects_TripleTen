# Zuber_Database Project

## Introduction <a id='intro'></a>

In this Project we received access to the Zuber Database to analyze different patterns in the data and find out how weather effects ride times from the Loop to O'Hare International Airport.

### Goal: 
Our main goals were:
1. Conduct an exploratory data analysis with the data provided, as shown in Tasks 1-4 in the code. 
2. Find out whether ride duration changes on rainy Saturdays from the Loop to O'Hare.

### Stages 

 
The project consisted of two stages:
 1. Exploratory analysis.
 2. Extract data to discover if ride times are affected on Saturdays when it rains.


After conducting our analysis, we concluded:

1. Ride times where longer in duration on average when there was rain on Saturdays. We recommended that the company have more drivers available when rain is expected in the forecast.
